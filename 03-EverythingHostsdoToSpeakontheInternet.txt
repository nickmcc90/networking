We will explain how hosts communicate through two scenarios:

1. Hosts connected directly to each other.
  Basically two hosts in the SAME network
2. Hosts connected to each other through a router.
  Basically host talking to host in a foriegn network.

-----Situation 1-----
So Host A and B are directly connected. Both of them have
a NIC, and therefore a MAC address.
Both hosts have a IP and subnet mask (a subnet masks identifies
the size of the IP network.)

Host A has data to send to B. Host A knows the IP address
of B. And Host A knows B is in its network.
  The user could have typed: ping 'some ip address'
  Or it was acquired through DNS (conversion of domain name
  to IP).

Host A will create a layer 3 packet, then add a layer 2 thing
to it. The problem is host A doesn't know B's MAC address. How
do we get around this?

Host A will use ARP, which links a layer 3 address to a particular
layer 2 address. The ARP pretty much says: 

"If anyone out there has the IP 'blank blank', send me your MAC.
My IP is __ and my MAC is __. "

This ARP is a broadcast, so it's sent to everyone on the network. The
dest MAC address on a ARP request is ffff.ffff.ffff, which is meant
for everyone on the network.

There are things called ARP caches. Each host has one, and they include
a storage of all the IP and MAC pairings of other hosts. Once the ARP 
request reaches B and Host A and B communicate, both A and B's ARP
cache will be populated with each other's IP and MAC pair.

Once the ARP request is done, Host A can now finish up the dest MAC
that was required initially to send the data.
